## Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent to solve a grid-based Treasure Hunt game. The objective is to train an intelligent agent (the "pirate") to navigate a maze and reach a treasure while avoiding invalid or suboptimal moves. <br><br>
The notebook demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to path-finding problems using neural networks and Q-learning, combining concepts from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and gaming environments. <br><br>
This project was completed as academic coursework and is included in my e-portfolio.
